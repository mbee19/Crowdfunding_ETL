# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 for Morgan Bee and Brian Hester

In this project, we worked with all the class activities, Khaled's class notes, and the following sources to help us complete the project. 

For the 'contacts' section, we used this Stack Overflow article: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4917006string-to-dictionary-in-python to transform json object to a dictionary. We also used chat gpt to help us figure out that we needed to split the lines to eliminate extra information not needed with this line of code: 
```new_line_split = str(row[1]).split("\n")```

In the sql section, this article helped refresh the acceptable datatypes in sql: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypesasp.
